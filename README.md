# Folder-Locker
Folder Locker using C++

Step 1: Make a folder called "Secret_Folder", then place the locker.exe(located in bin/Debug) into the same directory of the Secret_Folder.

Step 2: Open the locker.exe and type 1234 for the password.

Step 3: Access the Secret_Folder through locker.exe using commands.

Note: The Secret_Folder will be automatically locked every time you properly close the locker.exe for safety measures.
once the "Secret_folder" is locked, its name will be replaced with "Secret_Folder.Locked". You can edit the code and recompile it so that you can replace that default password
and folder name. I used code blocks as my IDE to make this program.
